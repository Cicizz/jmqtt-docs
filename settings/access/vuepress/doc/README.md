## Features

* Developed in Java and Netty, it supports plug-in mode with high performance and high scalability.
* Support mqtt protocol qos0, qos1, qos2 message quality service.
* Supports cleansession, retain, will and other message services in the mqtt protocol.
* Full support for mqtt Topic match filtering.
* Support websocket protocol.
* Support RocksDB for data local storage to make data highly reliable.

## Quick Start

### Online testing
Online test environment：`120.24.69.113`，TCP port ：`1883`；Websocket port：`1884`.

### Running locally
1. Download the [release](https://github.com/Cicizz/jmqtt/releases) version or `clone` this project.
2. Execute in the root directory：`mvn -Ppackage-all -DskipTests clean install -U`
3. (there's a bug in v1.1.0 script, so we have to handle it manually) add a system environment variable, key=`JMQTT_HOME`, value=`YOUR_PATH_TO_JMQTT\jmqtt-distribution\target\jmqtt`. The purpose of the configuration is to specify the address where the jmqtt configuration file and log configuration file are located.
4. Run the jmqttstart script directly in the `jmqtt-distrubution/target/jmqtt/bin` directory.

### Debugging with IDE
Take IDEA for example:
1. Download the [release](https://github.com/Cicizz/jmqtt/releases) version or `clone` this project.
2. Open it with IDEA, and choose "Add as a maven project"
3. Local launch: find the BrokerStartup class and configure the startup environment variable: The key is `JMQTT_HOME`, and the value is the absolute address where `jmqtt-distribution` is located. The purpose of the configuration is to specify the address where the jmqtt configuration file and log configuration file are located.

### Running with Docker
1. Clone this project
2. Run `docker build -t jmqtt .`
3. Run `docker run -d -p 1883:1883 -p 1884:1884 --name jmqtt-broker jmqtt`
   1. If you would like to add your custom `conf` folder (default is `jmqtt-distribution/conf`), add `-v <path_to_your_conf>:/var/jmqtt-data/conf` to bind a volume. The `jmqtt.properties` file contained in your config folder is being used in `BrokerStartup`.

## Architecture Design

## Module introduction and local environment

* **broker**：Mqtt protocol layer. logical processing. BrokerStartup is the startup class, BrokerController is the initialization class, initialize all the necessary environment, where the plugin configuration of acl, store must also be initialized here.
* **common**：Common layer. Used to store tool classes, bean classes, etc.
* **remoting**：Communication layer. Used for connection management, protocol analysis, heartbeat, etc.
* **distribution**：Configuration module. Used for configuration files, start and stop commands, etc.
* **example**：Client example. Only java and websocket examples are supported currently.
* **manage**：Management module, mainly involved in dynamic configuration and system monitoring and other functions
* **store**：Storage module. Provides several interfaces for mqtt protocol data, supports memory-based and Rocksdb local storage.
